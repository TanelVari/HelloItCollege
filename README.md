Font used in UI: Kongtext Regular
Licence based upon Bitstream's Vera font set <http://www.gnome.org/fonts/>.
Short summary of the licence (excerpt from the font's licence file):
"With one specific exception, you have full permission to bundle these fonts in your own free or commercial projects-- and by projects, I'm referring to not just software but also electronic documents and print publications.

So what's the exception? Simple: you can't re-sell these fonts in a commercial font collection. I've seen too many font CDs for sale in stores that are just a repackaging of thousands of freeware fonts found on the internet, and in my mind, that's quite a bit like highway robbery. Note that this *only* applies to products that are font collections in and of themselves; you may freely bundle these fonts with an operating system, application program, or the like."
